# AccessLM Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: February 5, 2026

AccessLM is a **privacy-first, decentralized AI tool** designed for students, researchers, and anyone without access to powerful hardware.

## We Do Not Collect

- Your IP address
- Your location
- Your device ID
- Your prompts or responses
- Your usage patterns
- Any personal information

## How It Works

AccessLM connects your device to a peer-to-peer network to run large language models (LLMs).  Your device may:

- Request model layers from other peers
- Serve model layers to other peers

All communication is:
- Encrypted end-to-end (libp2p)
- Temporary (no storage)
- Anonymous (no identifiers)

## No Data Stored

- No logs are written to disk.
- No data is sent to any server.
- No cookies or local storage are used.
- The app deletes all memory on exit.

## Legal Basis

Under GDPR Article 6(1)(e) and ePrivacy Directive, AccessLM operates as a **non-processing tool**.  We are not a data controller. We are a **technical enabler** — like a web browser.
